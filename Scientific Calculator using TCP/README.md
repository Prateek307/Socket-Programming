# Scientific Calculator using TCP

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator using TCP! This project allows you to perform mathematical operations on a remote server using a client connected via TCP.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

### Running the Server

Compile and run the server program

### Running the Client

Compile and run the client program
ADD -n 3 100 200 300
The above command is to add 3 numbers 100,200,300 and n represent the total number that are to be added
User
i am creating  a reaadme file for scientific calculator using tcp
so create a readme file for it
here is the content 
run the server program on one computer and client program on another computer make sure to enter the ip address of the computer on which the server is running on the client porgram
give the following commands
ADD -n 3 100 200 300
the above command is to add 3 numbers 100,200,300 and n represent the total number that are to be added 
similarly,
SUB -n 2 200 100
MUL -n 2 100 200
DIV <numerator> <denominator>
for example DIV 20 5 that is 20 divided by 5
